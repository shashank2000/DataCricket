    "What I am trying to do:\n",
    "- look at each player, and classify them as 'batsmen' or 'bowlers' or 'all rounders' - with this model, the best player in the world is the best bowler and best batman. All rounders are just as effective as really good batsmen/bowlers - not actually true/debatable. \n",

    "every player has a score. Each time the team the player is on wins, he gets a point (seniority's gotta count for something)\n",
    "I realized this is not something that is super feasible, so I instead tried to model the runs scored by Virat Kohli in every game in the IPL. Generalize this with a Beta, and then we have uncertainty as well - that will be the prior and we can use MAP. \n",
